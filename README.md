# HCI-VIS Lab Research Project

The underlying goal of this research project was to create a visualization to represent the supervisor-supervisee relationship between published authors in the HCI-VIS field and to merge some of the labâ€™s major datasets together. I worked with post-doc researcher Natkamon Tonovich, Professor Ali, and Professor Narges at UMass Amherst.

Here is my final [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kaqn8p7UeC5Qct9n9AOQxZEvoOicuEwVm4ekqHp97dg/edit?usp=sharing).
